farcry-plugin-blogfc
====================

This is a simple blog plugin for the FarCry Core platform. It was designed as an upgrade path from BlogCFC 
and contains an importer for BlogCFC posts and categories, as well as a comment exporter than can be used
with Disqus.

At this time the plugin is used on madfellas.com but is not yet considered released or supported. That said,
feel free to fork it if you like :)
